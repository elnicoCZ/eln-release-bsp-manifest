SQM4 Repo Manifest README

This is an extension of the i.MX Repo Manifest (https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-manifest).

This repo is used to download manifests for SQM4 BSPs, based on the official i.MX BSP releases.

Specific instructions will reside in READMEs in each branch.

The branch will be based on the release type Linux or Android with release manifests in each branch tied to the base releases.

For example for i.MX Linux Yocto Project releases the branches will be imx_linux_<Yocto Project release> so imx_linux_sumo with all manifests tied to releases on sumo in this branch.

To use this manifest repo, the 'repo' tool must be installed first.
